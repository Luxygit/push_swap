chunk sorting: 
	parse input
	check duplicates
	create indexes
	hardcode small cases
	splitting A in chunks (number of chunks depending on number of elements)
	IF top A element is within each chunk then push to B
		IF  number is lower than the middle of the chunk then RB
	ELSE rotate A
	WHILE B not empty rotate or reverserotate B to find max and push it to A
